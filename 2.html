    <h2>We have a class named as "Car".It has a constructor and one method named "Move".Constructor method has a 2 parameter:position and speed.
        <br>Constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created within a class.
        <br>Here is an important point that a class cannot have more than one constructor() method. This will throw a SyntaxError.
        <br>Position parameter has "O" as default value and speed has "42" as default value.There is a class named "SelfDrivingCar" which inherited the method from the "Car" class using the "extends" keyword.
        <br>After that "Move" method is calling with super keyword.Super() method refers to the parent class.We can call the constructor of the base class using "super".In this code our parent/base class is "Car" and sub/child class is "SelfDrivingCar".
        <br>Actually we're calling the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods.
