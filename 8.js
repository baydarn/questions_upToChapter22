//i used "call" and "apply" methods to call a method.
person.bio(); //Will return my name is John Doe
person.bio.call(person) // call() method can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
person.bio.apply(person) // if we had an another properties like "city" or "country",then we could use person method like this (person,["Ankara","Ä°stanbul"]).
person.bio.bind(person)  //The bind() method allows an object to borrow a method from another object without making a copy of that method. This is known as function borrowing in JavaScript.
