        First of all, the result using Object.assign, _.assign and _.extend are actually the same. Javascript is a pass-by-sharing language. Whenever you declare a variable and assign an object to it, as i said, you assign the object to the variable : it doesnâ€™t copy it in any way, it just holds a reference to it.
    <br>Object.create() makes use of the Prototype property. Actually it just takes an object as a parameter and return a new object having the parameter as a prototype.
    <br>Assign is useful when you want to make a shallow copy of a variable.Merge will create a deep copy of an other object.
    <br> is the best example of simulating OO in JS. You have an original object, with attributes and method, and you want other object to be an extension of it, without making unecessary duplications ?
