        Babel is a transpiler (translates code in one language to another computer language at the same abstraction level) that can turn our ES6 code into ES5.
        So i used Babel for this convertion.In ES5,there is no class keyword.We use "function" instead of "class".
        And also there is no let and const keyword in ES5.The "const" and "let" keywords have been replaced by "var".
        The arrow function has been replaced by a function expression.
        The template literal has been replaced by string concatenation operators.
        <br>Using prototype Object we will do inheritance in ES5.
        <br>First,we need to understand about class in JavaScript.
        In the convertion,we saw that there is a constructor function and a prototype object.
        <br>A prototype object is the shared space of a class instances. 
        <br>Any property of method of class is being accessed, JS interpreter first lookup that property in that object if it is not available, then it lookup into its prototype, if it is not there, then lookup into its parent’s prototype and so on.
        Inheritance is inheriting features of one class by another class.
        JavaScript supports both, classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance.
        <br>JavaScript only supports single and multi-level inheritance.
        So we create base class in ES5 and we create methods on prototype of the base(parent) class.
        And then we create child class and call its base class with required parameters.
        <br>We're executing constructor of parent class from the constructor function of child class in child class’s scope. It is similar to calling super.
        <br>Then,we create prototype object for child class from parent class.
        <br>And we may add methods on prototype of child class.
        <br>Now we can create instance of child class and can access properties and methods of parent class too from that instance.
