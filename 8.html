    <h3>
        The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods so they can both be used to call an object method with another object as an argument.
        <br>The difference Between call() and apply() --> call() method takes arguments separately. <br>On the other hand apply() method takes arguments as an array.
        <br>From the MDN docs on Function.prototype.bind() :
        <br>The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
        <br>I also found this definition from https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-bind/#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20bind()%20method&text=bind(thisArg%5B%2C%20arg1%5B,t%20immediately%20execute%20the%20function.
        <br>The bind() method allows an object to borrow a method from another object without making a copy of that method. This is known as function borrowing in JavaScript.
