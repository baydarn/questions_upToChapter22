        There is no "class" keyword in ES5.JavaScript ES5 didn't support classes but as we can see in our code segment TypeScript support this feature from ES6.
        Generally we use to implement class-like functionalities using "functions".Also javascript did allow for static members to be declared in the ES5 version.
        So i converted this code to ES5 using all this information.
